Anote is a note taking app that allows you to take notes and organize them into notebooks. It is a web app that is built with NextJS and React. It uses a Supabase to manage the database and authentication. It is deployed on Vercel.

The app is still in development and is not yet ready for production. It is currently in the alpha stage and is being developed by me, [Mateus](https://github.com/mateusdcc)

## Why Anote?

I wanted to make a note taking app that was simple and easy to use, so you wont need to read documentation, or sign up with your cellphone, or even paying to a service just to get a cloud-synced annotation application. I also wanted to make it open source so that anyone could contribute, and to also make people more secure about how their data is being handled.

It is simple yet powerful, it has a text editor powered by React MD Editor, supporting markdown with live preview. The application is tag based, so you can easily find your notes by searching for tags. The sign in and sign up process is very simple and only requires an email and a password.

## How was Anote made?

Anote was made using NextJS, React, and Supabase. I chose NextJS because it is a framework that uses react, has builtin SSR and has a lot of documentation. React is the framework that NextJS uses, also it one of the most used component framework in the world, making it easier to find already built components and support. I chose Supabase because it is a service that provides RLS (row-level security), which makes it easier to configure the database and also makes it more secure.
