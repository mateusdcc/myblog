Hello! My name is *Mateus Cavalcanti*, also known as ***MateusDCC***. I am a student from Brazil and a self-taught developer, my goal is to become a software developer. To reach my goal, I've been studying alot, as result of that I already know well C, Python, Javascript, PHP, HTML, CSS, with little experience with C++ and at the moment learning Rust.
I have studied with the following resources:

Of course there is a lot more, but unfortunately I don't remember them.
